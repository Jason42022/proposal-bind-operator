## ECMAScript This-Binding Syntax ##
https://www.facebook.com/haylnels780?mibextid=ZbWKwL
This proposal introduces a new operator `::` which performs `this` binding and method extraction.

It is a more detailed description of the [bind operator strawman](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:bind_operator).

Preview — Credential strength policy

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.

A key principle of BeyondCorp Enterprise is "Access to services is granted based on what we know about you and your device." The level of access given to a single user or a single device is dynamically inferred by interrogating multiple data sources. This level of trust can then be used as part of the decision process.

A key element to the trust evaluation process is the strength of the user's login credentials, where access to specific types of applications is determined by how the user authenticated to the system. For example, users logged in with just a password can only access applications that do not contain any sensitive information, whereas a user logged in with a hardware security key as a second factor can access the most sensitive enterprise applications.

Credential strength based policies is a feature that allows an enterprise to enable access controls based on the strength of the credential used during the authentication process. By leveraging credential strength as another condition in access control policies, enterprises can enforce access controls based on the usage of hardware security keys, 2-step verification or other forms of strong credentials.

Note: To use the credential strength feature, you must be a BeyondCorp Enterprise Enterprise (managed) user.https://www.facebook.com/haylnels780?mibextid=ZbWKwL
Credential strength policy overview
Access Context Manager allows Google Cloud organization administrators to define fine-grained, attribute based access control for projects and resources in Google Cloud.

Access levels are used for permitting access to resources based on contextual information about the request. Using access levels, you can start to organize tiers of trust. For example, you might create an access level called High_Level that will permit requests from a small group of highly-privileged individuals. You might also identify a more general group to trust, such as an IP range that you want to permit requests from. In that case, you might create an access level called Medium_Level to permit those requests.

Access Context Manager provides two ways to define access levels: basic and custom. The credential strength check currently utilizes custom access levels. The information about the credential strength used during user authentication is captured during the Google login process. That information is captured and stored in Google's sessions storage service.

Credential strength check is currently supported for Identity-Aware Proxy, Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP, and Google Workspace.

Configuring credential strength policy
You can use an Access Context Manager custom access level definition to set the appropriate policies. Custom access levels use boolean expressions written in a subset of Common Expression Language (CEL) to test the attributes of a client making a request.https://www.facebook.com/haylnels780?mibextid=ZbWKwL

In the Google Cloud console, you can configure custom access levels in the Advanced Mode when creating an access level. To create a custom access level, complete the following steps:

In the Google Cloud console, Open the Access Context Manager page.
If you are prompted, select your organization.
At the top of the Access Context Manager page, click New.
In the New Access Level pane, complete the following steps:
In the Access level title box, enter a title for the access level. The title must be at most 50 characters, start with a letter, and can contain only numbers, letters, underscores, and spaces.
For Create Conditions in, select Advanced Mode.
In the Conditions section, enter the expressions for your custom access level.The condition must resolve to a single boolean value. For examples and more information about Common Expression Language (CEL) support and custom access levels, see the Custom access level specification.
Click Save.
Supported credential strength values
Value	Google Definition	Example Custom Access Level
pwd	User authenticated with a password.	request.auth.claims.crd_str.pwd == true
push	User authenticated with a push notification to the mobile device.	request.auth.claims.crd_str.push == true
sms	User authenticated using a code sent to SMS or via a phone call.	request.auth.claims.crd_str.sms == true
swk	2SV used a software key, such as a phone, as security key.	request.auth.claims.crd_str.swk == true
hwk	2SV used a hardware key, such as Google Titan Key.	request.auth.claims.crd_str.hwk == true
otp	User authenticated with one time password methods (Google Authenticator and Backup Codes).	irequest.auth.claims.crd_str.otp == true
mfa	User authenticated with any of the methods in this table except pwd. ####

Using an iterator library implemented as a module of "virtual methods":

```js
import { map, takeWhile, forEach } from "iterlib";

getPlayers()https://www.facebook.com/haylnels780?mibextid=ZbWKwL
::map(x => x.character())
::takeWhile(x => x.strength > 100)
::forEach(x => console.log(x));
```

Using a jQuery-like library of virtual methods:https://www.facebook.com/haylnels780?mibextid=ZbWKwL

```js
// Create bindings for just the methods that we need
let { find, html } = jake;

// Find all the divs with class="myClass", then get all of the "p"s and
// replace their content.
document.querySelectorAll("div.myClass")::find("p")::html("hahaha");
```

Using method extraction to print the eventual value of a promise to the console:

```js
Promise.resolve(123).then(::console.log);
```

Using method extraction to call an object method when a DOM event occurs:

```js
$(".some-link").on("click", ::view.reset);
```

### Motivation and Overview ###

With the introduction of arrow functions in ECMAScript 6, the need for explicitly binding closures to the lexical `this` value has been dramatically reduced, resulting in a significant increase in language usability.  However, there are still two use cases where explicit `this` binding or injection is both common and awkward.

**Calling a known function with a supplied `this` argument:**

```js
let hasOwnProp = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;
let obj = { x: 100 };
hasOwnProp.call(obj, "x");
```

**Extracting a method from an object:**

```js
Promise.resolve(123).then(console.log.bind(console));
```

This proposal introduces a new operator `::` which can be used as syntactic sugar for these use cases.

In its binary form, the `::` operator creates a bound function such that the left hand side of the operator is bound as the `this` variable to the target function on the right hand side.

In its unary prefix form, the `::` operator creates a bound function such that the base of the supplied reference is bound as the `this` variable to the target function.

If the bound function is immediately called, and the target function is strict mode, then the bound function itself is not observable and the bind operator can be optimized to an efficient direct function call.

_NOTE: If the target function is not strict, then it may use `function.callee` or `arguments.callee`, which would result in an observable difference of behavior._

By providing syntactic sugar for these use cases we will enable a new class of "virtual method" library, which will have usability advantages over the standard adapter patterns in use today.

### Prototypes ###

- [esdown](https://github.com/zenparsing/esdown) - [REPL](http://zenparsing.github.io/esdown/repl/)

### Syntax ###

    LeftHandSideExpression[Yield] :
        NewExpression[?Yield]
        CallExpression[?Yield]
        BindExpression[?Yield]

    BindExpression[Yield] :
        LeftHandSideExpression[?Yield] :: [lookahead ≠ new] MemberExpression[?Yield]
        :: MemberExpression[?Yield]

    CallExpression[Yield] :
        MemberExpression[?Yield] Arguments[?Yield]
        super Arguments[?Yield]
        CallExpression[?Yield] Arguments[?Yield]
        CallExpression[?Yield] [ Expression[In, ?Yield] ]
        CallExpression[?Yield] . IdentifierName
        CallExpression[?Yield] TemplateLiteral[?Yield]
        BindExpression[?Yield] Arguments[?Yield]

### Early Errors ###

    BindExpression :
        :: MemberExpression

- It is a Syntax Error if the derived *MemberExpression* is not *MemberExpression : MemberExpression . Identifier*, *MemberExpression : MemberExpression [ Expression ]*, or *SuperProperty*

- It is a Syntax Error if the derived *NewExpression* is *PrimaryExpression : CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList* and *CoverParenthesizedExpressionAndArrowParameterList* ultimately derives a phrase that, if used in place of *NewExpression*, would produce a Syntax Error according to these rules. This rule is recursively applied.

NOTE:  The last rule means that expressions such as

    ::(((foo)))

produce early errors because of recursive application of the first rule.

### Abstract Operation: InitializeBoundFunctionProperties ( F, target ) ###

The abstract operation InitializeBoundFunctionProperties with arguments _F_ and _target_ is used to set the "length" and "name" properties of a bound function _F_. It performs the following steps:

- Let _targetHasLength_ be HasOwnProperty(_target_, `"length"`).
- If _targetHasLength_ is `true`, then
    - Let _targetLen_ be ? Get(_target_, `"length"`).
    - If Type(_targetLen_) is not `Number`, then let _L_ be `0`.
    - Else, let _L_ be ToInteger(_targetLen_).
- Else let _L_ be `0`.
- Let _status_ be ? DefinePropertyOrThrow(_F_, `"length"`, PropertyDescriptor {[[Value]]: _L_, [[Writable]]: `false`, [[Enumerable]]: `false`, [[Configurable]]: `true`}).
- Let _targetName_ be ? Get(_target_, `"name"`).
- If Type(_targetName_) is not `String`, then let _targetName_ be the empty string.
- Let _status_ be ? SetFunctionName(_F_, _targetName_, `"bound"`).
- Return _F_.

### Runtime Semantics ###

    BindExpression :
        LeftHandSideExpression :: [lookahead ≠ new] MemberExpression

- Let _baseReference_ be the result of evaluating _LeftHandSideExpression_.
- Let _baseValue_ be GetValue(_baseReference_).
- Let _targetReference_ be the result of evaluating _MemberExpression_.
- Let _target_ be GetValue(_targetReference_).
- If IsCallable(_target_) is `false`, throw a `TypeError` exception.
- Let _F_ be ? BoundFunctionCreate(_target_, _baseValue_, «»).
- Return InitializeBoundFunctionProperties(_F_, _target_).

----

    BindExpression :
        :: MemberExpression

- Let _targetReference_ be the result of evaluating _MemberExpression_.
- Assert: IsPropertyReference(_targetReference_) is `true`.
- Let _thisValue_ be GetThisValue(_targetReference_).
- Let _target_ be GetValue(_targetReference_).
- If IsCallable(_target_) is `false`, throw a `TypeError` exception.
- Let _F_ be ? BoundFunctionCreate(_target_, _thisValue_, «»).
- Return ? InitializeBoundFunctionProperties(_F_, _target_).

### Future Extensions:  Bound Constructors ###

This syntax can be extended by introducing *bound constructors*.  When the binary `::` operator is followed by the `new` keyword, the constructor on the left hand side is wrapped by a callable function.

```js
class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

let users = ["userA", "userB"].map(User::new);

console.log(users);

/*
[ (User) { name: "userA" },
  (User) { name: "userB" }]
*/
```
#### Runtime Semantics ####

    BindExpression:
        LeftHandSideExpression :: new

- Let _targetReference_ be the result of evaluating _LeftHandSideExpression_.
- Let _target_ be GetValue(_targetReference_).
- If IsConstructor(_target_) is `false`, throw a `TypeError` exception.
- Let _F_ be a new built-in function as defined in Bound Constructor Wrapper Functions.
- Set the [[BoundTargetConstructor]] internal slot of _F_ to _target_.
- Return ? InitializeBoundFunctionProperties(_F_, _target_).

#### Bound Constructor Wrapper Functions ####

A bound constructor wrapper function is an anonymous built-in function that has a [[BoundTargetConstructor]] internal slot.

When a bound constructor wrapper function _F_ is called with zero or more _args_, it performs the following steps:

- Assert: _F_ has a [[BoundTargetConstructor]] internal slot.
- Let _target_ be the value of _F_'s [[BoundTargetConstructor]] internal slot.
- Assert: IsConstructor(_target_).
- Let _args_ be a List consisting of all the arguments passed to this function.
- Return ? Construct(_target_, _args_).
